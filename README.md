### What I learned

For this project, I tried to create a simple animation for the "Proceed to payment". That's the first time I tried this and I think it looks great!

Here's the code:

```css
@keyframes bounce {
  0%, 100% {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }

  50% {
    transform: translateY(-3px);
  }
}
```

If you want more help with animations, I really recommend checking out [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp) to learn more.
